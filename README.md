**THE Advanced Application Manager Generator**  or **AAMG** is a Python library for creating **AAMs** from A to Z using Python.

**NOTE: THE AAMG and any AAM CAN ONLY work in any windows operating system(\*1) which can support python 3.8 and above**

**\*1: THE AAMG and any kind of AAM wasn't test on an 32-bit operating system but only 64-bit operating system only**

**AAMG** produces **custom AAMs** by using a Variety of Parameters which enable it
to produce AAMs for **any application or purpose**.

Advanced Application Manager or AAM is a very flexable and useful way to install dependencies and requirements for a specific app,
each AAM is made specifically for a specific application, and the only way to make an AMM is to use the AAMG python library
which is has been **made using pure python and standard libraries only**
